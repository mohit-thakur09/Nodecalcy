**Project Name:** "Node.js Calculator"

**Description:**
Create a versatile and user-friendly calculator application using Node.js. This calculator should handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can be extended to support advanced operations like square roots, percentages, and trigonometric functions if desired. Users can interact with the calculator through a command-line interface or a web-based GUI.

**Key Features:**
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Command-line interface for quick calculations.
- History feature to view past calculations.

**Technologies:**
- Node.js for the back-end logic.
- Express.js for creating a web-based calculator (if applicable).
- Command-line interaction for the CLI version.
- Math.js or similar libraries for handling complex mathematical operations.
- Any front-end framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) if building a web-based GUI.

**Getting Started:**
- Install Node.js and any required dependencies.
- Implement the calculator's core logic for arithmetic operations.
- Create a CLI version for command-line interactions.
- If building a web-based GUI, set up Express.js for routing and rendering.
- Design the user interface for a pleasant user experience.
- Test the calculator thoroughly to ensure accurate calculations.

**Customization:**
You can customize this project by choosing the interface (CLI, web-based GUI, or both), adding more advanced mathematical functions, or incorporating any specific features you desire.

**Contributing:**
Open-source contributions and enhancements are encouraged. Users can contribute by improving the user interface, adding more mathematical functions, optimizing the code, or fixing bugs.

**License:**
This project can be licensed under an open-source license, such as the MIT License, to allow for widespread use and contributions.

A Node.js calculator project can be a fun and educational way to explore JavaScript, Node.js, and web development. You can also make it as simple or as complex as you like, depending on your goals and learning objectives.
